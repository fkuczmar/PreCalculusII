\begin{question} \label{Q34d4r34tgFG}
For each of the following expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain its meaning in a complete sentence.

\item Evaluate the expression without using a caclulator. Draw a picture to help with your explanation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cos (\arccos(-3/8))$

\item $\arccos (\cos (4\pi/5))$

\item $\arccos (\cos (7\pi))$

\item $\arccos (\cos (7\pi/5))$

\item $\arcsin (\sin (7\pi/5))$

\item $\arccos (\cos (16\pi/9))$

\item $\arcsin (\sin (16\pi/9))$

\item $\arcsin(\sin (23\pi /7))$

\item $\arcsin(\sin (-23\pi /7))$

\item $\arccos(\sin (\pi /7))$

\item $\arccos(\sin (12\pi /7))$

\item $\sin(\arccos(-3/4))$

\item $\cos(\arcsin(-3/4))$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{explanation}
(d) The expression $\arccos (\cos (7\pi/5))$ is the angle between $0$ and $\pi$ that has the same cosine as the angle $7\pi/5$.

To evaluate this expression, we'll let 
\[
   \theta = \arccos (\cos (7\pi/5)).
\] 

From our description, we know
\begin{enumerate}
\item $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$, and

\item $\cos \theta =  \cos(7\pi/5))$.
\end{enumerate}

We should point out that because $7\pi/5$ is \emph{not} between $0$ and $\pi$,
\[
   \theta =   \arccos (\cos (7\pi/5)) \neq 7\pi/5 .
\]

To determine the value of $\theta$, we'll work on the unit circle and start by stetching the point $P$ on the unit circle with coordinates $(\cos (7\pi/5), \sin(7\pi/5))$ and polar angle 
\[
     \angle AOP =  \frac{7\pi}{5} = \pi + \frac{2\pi}{5} .
\]

See the picture below.

Now there are infinitely many other choices for the polar angle of $P$ (or to be more precise, for the polar angle of $\overrightarrow{OP}$), but because $P$ is in the third quadrant, none of these choices lies between $0$ and $\pi$. 

So we must find another family of angles with the same cosine as $7\pi/5$. To do this we draw the vertical line
\[
   x = \cos(7\pi/5)
\]
through $P$ and see where it intersects the unit circle a second time. We'll call this point $Q$. Now since $P$ and $Q$ share the same $x$-coordinate (and because $\cos\theta = x/r$), w know that
\[
 \cos (\angle AOP) = \cos (\angle AOQ).
\]
The angle $\angle AOQ$ is the one we're looking for. It has the same cosine as $\angle AOP = 7\pi/5$ and its measure is between $0$ and $\pi$. 


%This vertical line intersects the circle in two points, $P$ and $Q$. Because $Q$ is in the third quadrant, we cannot measure the polar angle of the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ to be between $0$ and $\pi$.

%So we should focus our attention on point $Q$, the other point where the line $x = \cos(7\pi/5)$ intersects the unit circle. We have infinitely many choices for the polar angle of the vector $\overrightarrow{OQ}$, but because $P$ and $Q$ have the same $x$-coordinate, each of these choices has the same cosine as the angle $7\pi/5$. We need to choose the one angle, the marked angle $\angle AOQ$, that is between $0$ and $\pi$. We can do this because $Q$ is in the second quadrant.

Because $P$ and $Q$ are symmetric about the $x$-axis, this measure of angle $\angle AOQ$ is
\[
   \angle AOQ = 2\pi - \frac{7\pi}{5} = \frac{3\pi}{5}.
\]
 
So our conclusion is that
\[
     \arccos (\cos (7\pi/5)) = \frac{3\pi}{5}.
\]

If we wanted to summarize our reasoning, we could give more detail like this:
\begin{align*}
 \arccos (\cos (7\pi/5)) &= \arccos (\cos (2\pi - 7\pi/5)) \\
                                 &= \arccos (\cos (3\pi/5)) \\
                                 & = 3\pi/5 .
\end{align*}


(e) The expression $\arcsin (\sin (7\pi/5))$ means the angle between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$ that has the same sine as the angle $7\pi/5$.

To find this angle we use reasoning much like we did to evaluate $\arccos (\cos (7\pi/5))$. But we need to make some adjustments to account for replacing the cosine and arccosine functions with sine and cosine.

I'll leave the details for you to fill in, but here's the picture we need.

You should finally conclude that
\begin{align*}
 \arcsin (\sin (7\pi/5)) &= \arcsin (\sin (\pi - 7\pi/5)) \\
                                 &= \arcsin (\sin (-2\pi/5)) \\
                                 & = -2\pi/5 .
\end{align*}
