%\section{Directions}
\emph{Directions:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show all work.

\item Give brief explanations for each problem. Include these explanations in the flow of the solution.

\item Show all units in all computations.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Part 1}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdgfg4thhnn}
Explain what it means to measure in angle in radians. Include a picture to help with your explanation.
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Q5543hghhjmmm}
 As you run around a circular track with radius $30$ meters you turn about the track's center at the constant rate of $0.2$ rad/sec.

\begin{enumerate}
\item At what speed are you running?

\item Explain the \emph{logic} behind your computation in part (a)?

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qcvfg44f}
Explain the difference between \emph{speed} and \emph{linear speed}.
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Qghhybyhyy}
Use a four-function calculator (if necessary) and the radian protractor below to approximate each of the following.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cos(-4.3)$

\item $\sin(5.2)$

\item $\sin(90)$

\item $\cos(\pi^\circ)$

\section{Part 2}

\begin{question}  \label{Q9dfe94tf4}

Between noon and 1:00 pm a beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle of radius $20$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed of $4$ meters/min. It passes the point $(0,-30)$ at 12:17 pm.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the protractor below to estimate the beetle's coordinates at 12:37pm.

\item Find the beetle's exact coordinates at 12:37pm.
%\item Use a calculator to approximate the coordinates from part (b) and compare this estimate with your original estimate from part (a).

\end{enumerate}

\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Qghggnmnree}
Let $Q$ be the point on the circle of radius $50$ meters that is $90$ meters from the point $A(50,0)$  (coordinates measured in meters). The distance is \emph{measured counterclockwise around the circle} from $A$ to $B$. 

Between 12:03pm and 1:00pm a beetle crawls clockwise around this circle at a constant speed of $7$ meters/min, passing the point $Q$ at 12:13pm.

\item Find functions 
\[
    x = f(t)
\]
and 
\[
 y = g(t)
\]
that express the beetle's coordinates (measured meters) as a function of the number of minutes past noon. Include a domain for 
each function.
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Q9dfdfhhhfe94tf4}

Between noon and 12:16 pm an ant and a beetle crawl around the circle of radius $40$ meters centered at the origin.  

The graphs of the functions
\[
  \theta = a(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 16
\]
and
\[
   \theta = b(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 16
\]
expressing their respective polar angles (in radians) in terms of the number of minutes past noon are shown below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the graphs above and the slider $u$ to approximate the first time when the bugs pass one another. 

\item Use algebra to find the \emph{exact} time when the bugs first pass one another.

\item Find \emph{where} the bugs pass one another for the first time. Give the exact coordinates..

\begin{question} \label{Qdgbhyy7777}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Use the animation below to approximate the first two times after 7:00pm when the minute and hour hands of a clock are perpendicular.

\item Find a function 
\[
  \theta = f(t) \, , \, t\in \mathbb{R}
\]
that expresses the angle between the hands (measured in radians) in terms of the number of hours past 7:00pm.

\item Use your function from part (b) to determine the \emph{exact} times in part (a).
