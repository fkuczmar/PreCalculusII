\section{Circular Interpolation with a Variable Protractor}

\begin{example}  \label{Ex:LLL}
We just completed the first third of spring and you've probably noticed how many more hours of daylight we get than we did than just a few months ago. On the vernal equinox (the first day of spring, usually March 21), Seattle gets 12 hours of daylight/day. And on the summer solstice (the first day of summer) we'll get just over 16 hours of daylight/day. 

The question is this. On April 21st, one-third of the way into spring, about how many hours of daylight per day do we get? Or more to the point, thinking proportionally and asking a question that would have the almost same answer for all latitudes, when we're one-third of the way through spring, through what fraction of the way from 12 hours/day to the maximum number of hours of daylight/day are we? One-third? Halfway? Two-thirds? What do you think?

The simplest way to approach this problem would be with a linear interpolation. Then when we're one-third of the way through spring in Seattle, we would be 1/3 of the way from $12$ to $16$ hours of daylight/day. So on April 21st we would expect to get about
\[
    12 \text{ hrs/day} + \frac{1}{3}(4 \text{ hrs/day}) = 13 \frac{1}{3}\text{ hrs/day}
\]
hours of daylight/day as illustrated in the graph below.

But this kind of piece-wise linear thinking does not seem quite right. We should not expect such abrupt transitions on the winter and summer solstices.

Instead of linear interpolation, we would do better to use \emph{circular interpolation}. For this, draw a circle of radius 
\[
     (16 - 12) \text{ hours of daylight/day} = 4 \text{ hours of daylight/day}
\]
centered at a point with $h$-coordinate $h=12$ as shown below. Now go $1/3$ of the way along the circle from point $A$ (corresponding to March 21, when we get $12$ hours of daylight/day) to point $M$ (corresponding to June 21, when we get $16$ hours of daylight/day).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Drag point $B$ above so that point $P$ lies $1/3$ of the way around the circle from $A$ to $M$. Then approximate how many hours of daylight/day we get on April 21st.

\item Use the worksheet above to approximate what days of the year we get $15$ hours of daylight/day. Explain your reasoning.

\end{freeResponse}
\end{enumerate}

This kind of circular interpolation is more accurate and gives a smoother function $h=g(t)$ for the number of hours of daylight/day. Graph this function by activating the Folder \emph{Circular interpolation} in the first worksheet.

\end{example}

%What is usually called \emph{sinusoidal modeling} is kind of a misnomer. First, it's usually easier to model osciallatory behavior with a cosine function. Second, and more importantly, the name \emph{sinusuoidal modeling} fails to convey the main idea of replacing linear interpolation with circular interpolation.

Here's another example.


\begin{example}  \label{E888b0bbdsdsf}
Suppose that over the course of a 24-hour period, from midnight October 29 to midnight October 30, the depth of the water at the Edmonds Pier is a sinusoidal function of time. Suppose also that a high tide of 21 feet occurs at 2:00am and the following low tide of 5 feet occurs at 8:00am. 

We'll ask two questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use circular interpolation with the protractor below to approximate the depth of the water at 5:30am on October 29.

\item Use the circular protractor to approximate the first two times after midnight when the water is $18$ feet deep.

Explain your reasoning and include screenshots to help with your explanations.
