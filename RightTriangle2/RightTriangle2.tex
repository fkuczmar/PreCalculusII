\begin{question} \label{Qfksadfsdt4e4}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How fast are we moving due to the rotation of the earth about its axis? Assume Shoreline is at a latitude of $47.75^\circ$N and take the radius of the earth to be $4000$ miles.

\item At what latitude(s) are people moving at a speed of $200$ miles/hour due to the rotation of the earth about its axis?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{QODfefEREr}
Assume for this problem that Shoreline and Spokane are both at a latitude of $47.75^\circ$N. Suppose also that the cities have respective longitudes $122.3^\circ$W and $117.4^\circ$W.

\begin{question} \label{QdfRERER}
You wrap a rubber band around a jar lid of radius $R$ cm and stretch the band as shown below.

Express the length (measured in cm) of the band in terms of $R$ and the distance $h$ between the point $P$ and the center of the lid, also measured in cm.

\begin{question} \label{QddtgHHERER}
Sensors on the ground at points $A$ and $B$ below measure the angles of elevation to a plane to be $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, respectively, as shown below.

Express the altitdue of the plane (in km) in terms of the distance $s$ between the sensors (also measured in km).
