Measuring angles in radians.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

The word \emph{radian} comes from radius. An angle of 2 radians with its vertex at the center of a circle, for example, subtends (cuts out) an arclength equal to twice the circle's radius. Put another way, the measure of the angle in radians is the ratio of the subtended arclength to the radius. Being the ratio of two lengths, the radian measure of the angle is dimensionless.

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:angles1}
Suppose you stand in place at point $A$ and face point $B$ in the desmos activity below. 

(a) Now turn counterclockwise until you face $C$ for the first time. Use the radian protractor to approximate the angle through which you turn during this time. Show a screenshot.

(b) Now turn back to face $B$ again (sitll standing at $A$). Then turn clockwise and stop when you face $C$ for the fifth time. Through approximately what angle do you turn during this time? 

(c) Turn back to face $B$ again (still standing at $A$). Then turn counterclockwise at the constant rate of $0.45$ rad/sec until you face $C$ for the tenth time. Approximately how long does this take?

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:angles2}
Two wheels with the same radius rotate at the same rate. One turns about its center, the other rolls on a road without slipping.

(a) Compare the speeds of points $P$ and $C$ below. Explain your reasoning. Include a screenshot to help with your explanation.

(b) If the wheels turn at the constant rate of $0.45$ rad/s and the wheel's have a radius of 10 cm, find the speed of the center of the rolling wheel. Do not use a  formula. Instead, do this logically and explain your reasoning. 

(c) Turn on the folder in Line 19 by clicking on the circle at the left of the line and play the animation. Then sketch graphs (on the same coordinate system) that show the speeds of points $P^\prime$ and $C$ as functions of time. No need for scales on the axes, but pay particular attention to the ratios of the speeds in drawing  your graphs.

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:angles2}
Experiment with the desmos activity below to determine an expression in $a$ and $b$ that gives the radian measure of the angle through which the rolling circle turns during the time it takes point $P$ to return to its intial position. Try to explain the logic behind the expression.
