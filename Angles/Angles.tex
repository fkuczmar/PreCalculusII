\begin{exploration}\label{exp:angles1}
Suppose you stand in place at point $A$, facing point $B$ in the desmos activity below. 

(a) Now turn counterclockwise until you face $C$ for the first time. Use the radian protractor to approximate the angle through which you turn during this time. Show a screenshot.

(b) Now turn back to face $B$ again (sitll standing at $A$). Turn clockwise and stop when you face $C$ for the fifth time. Through approximately what angle do you turn during this time? 

(c) Turn back to face $B$ again (still standing at $A$). Turn counterclockwise at the constant rate of $0.45$ rad/sec until you face $C$ for the tenth time. Approximately how long does this take?
