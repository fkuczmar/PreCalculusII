\begin{example}  \label{Exp89dfe94tf4}

A beetle crawls around the circle of radius $40$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed of $8$ meters/min, starting from the point $(40,0)$ at noon and making $5$ complete revolutions before stopping.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the protractor below to estimate the beetle's coordinates at 12:12pm. Explain your reasoning.

\item Find the beetle's exact coordinates at 12:12pm \emph{without} using a calculator.

\item Use a calculator to approximate the coordinates from part (b) and compare this estimate with your original estimate from part (a).

\end{enumerate}

\begin{example} \label{Edfhg]hghgdfg}
A beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle of radius $40$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed of $8$ meters/min, starting from the point $(40,0)$ (coordinates in meters) at noon and making $5$ complete revolutions before stopping.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a function
\[
    \theta = b(t)
\]
that expresses the beetle's polar angle in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domain.

The polar angle function is
\[
   \theta = b(t) = \answer{t/5} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item At what rate does the beetle turn about the origin?  $\answer{1/5}$ rad/min



\item Find functions
\[
   x = f_1(t) \text{ and } y=g_1(t)
\]
that express the beetle's coordinates (in meters)  in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domains.

The coordinate functions are
\[
    x = f_1(t) = \answer{40\cos(\frac{1}{5}t)} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} 
\]
and 
\[
    y = f_1(t) = \answer{40\sin(\frac{1}{5}t)} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item Enter these coordinate functions on Lines 3 and 4 of the worksheet below. Then play the slider $u$ (the number of minutes past noon) to check if they are correct.

An ant crawls \emph{clockwise} about the same circle at the constant speed of $5$ meters/min. It starts from the point $(0,40)$  (coordinates in meters) and stops at the same time as the beetle.
