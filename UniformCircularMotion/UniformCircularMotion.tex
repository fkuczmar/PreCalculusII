\begin{example}  \label{Exp89dfe94tf4}

A beetle crawls around the circle of radius $40$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed of $8$ meters/min, starting from the point $(40,0)$ at noon and making $5$ complete revolutions before stopping.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the protractor below to estimate the beetle's coordinates at 12:12pm. Explain your reasoning.

A beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle of radius $40$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed of $8$ meters/min, starting from the point $(40,0)$ (coordinates in meters) at noon and making $5$ complete revolutions before stopping.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a function
\[
    \theta = b(t)
\]
that expresses the beetle's polar angle in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domain.

The polar angle function is
\[
   \theta = b(t) = \answer{t/5} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item At what rate does the beetle turn about the origin?  $\answer{1/5}$ rad/min



\item Find functions
\[
   x = f_1(t) \text{ and } y=g_1(t)
\]
that express the beetle's coordinates (in meters)  in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domains.

The coordinate functions are
\[
    x = f_1(t) = \answer{40\cos(\frac{1}{5}t)} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} 
\]
and 
\[
    y = f_1(t) = \answer{40\sin(\frac{1}{5}t)} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item Enter these coordinate functions on Lines 3 and 4 of the worksheet below. Then play the slider $u$ (the number of minutes past noon) to check if they are correct.

An ant crawls \emph{clockwise} about the same circle at the constant speed of $5$ meters/min. It starts from the point $(0,-40)$  (coordinates in meters) and stops when the beetle does.

\item Find a function
\[
    \theta = a(t)
\]
that expresses the ant's polar angle in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domain.

The polar angle function is
\[
   \theta = a(t) = \answer{t/8} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item At what rate does the ant turn about the origin?  $\answer{1/8}$ rad/min



\item Find functions
\[
   x = f_2(t) \text{ and } y=g_2(t)
\]
that express the ant's coordinates (in meters)  in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domains.

%The coordinate functions are
%\[

\item When do the insects meet for the first time. Give an exact time Do this \emph{without} relying on the animation and \emph{without} using a calculator. Then use a calculator to approximate this time and use the animation above as a check.

\item \emph{Where} do the insects meet for the first time. Give \emph{exact} coordinatges \emph{without} relying on the animation and \emph{without} using a calculator. Then use a calculator to approximate the coordinates and use the animation above as a check.

\item After the first meeting, how often do the insects meet? Give an exact time interval \emph{without} relying on the animation and \emph{without} using a calculator. Then use a calculator to approximate the time interval and use the animation above as a check.

\item Find a function 
\[
    t = h(n)
\]
that gives the exact time when the bugs meet for the $n$th time. Include the appropriate domain.
