\begin{exercise}  \label{Ex:44r4nj3r33g3e}

A block at the end of a spring oscillates in simple harmonic motion on a frictionless surface as shown below. The spring is stretched two meters from beyond its relaxed (ie. unstretched) length and then released from rest at $x=2$ m, completing one oscillation about the origin every 5 seconds. The block makes four complete oscillations before a dog intervenes and the problem ends.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a function 
\[
  x=f(\theta) \, , \, 0 \leq \theta \leq \answer{8\pi}
\]
that express the position (ie. the $x$-coordinate) of the block in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ of the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ from the origin to the point $P$ that drives the simple harmonic motion.

\item Find a function 
\[
 \theta = a(t) \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{20} , 
\]
that expesses the  polar angle in terms of the number of seconds since the mass was released.

\item Then find a function
\[
     x = g(t) \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{20} ,
\]
that expresses the position (in meters) of the mass in terms of the number of seconds since the mass was released.

\item What equation would you solve to find all times when the block has position $x=1.4$ meters?

\item To solve the equation in part (d), first make the substitution $\theta = (2\pi/5) t$ and then find the \emph{exact} polar angles of the driving point when the block has position $x=1.4$ meters. Do \emph{not} use a calculator.

\item Then find the \emph{exact} times when the block has position $x=1.4$ meters. Do \emph{not} use a calculator.

\item Use the radian protractor above to approximate the two smallest angles in part (e). Then use these to approximate the first two times the block has position $x=1.4$ meters.

\item Use a calculator and the results of part (f) to approximate the first two times the block has position $x=1.4$ meters.

\item When does the block have position $x=1.4$ meters for the \emph{last} time? Give the exact time and then a decimal approximation.

\begin{exercise}  \label{Ex:LmDmr3r33343}
A block at the end of a spring oscillates with a period of $8$ seconds in simple harmonic motion between positions $y=\pm 5$ meters along the $y$-axis as shown below. The block passes the origin on its way up at time $t=1$ second.  The block makes five complete oscillations before a dog intervenes and the problem ends.

Repeat the parts of Question 1 for this scenario, finding polar angles and times (as in Question 1) when the block has position $y=-2$ meters.
