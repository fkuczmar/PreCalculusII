\begin{exercise} \label{ELDKFe5ytef}
Assume each of the motions below are at a constant speed around a circle with a radius measured in meters. Assume also that time is measured in seconds.

For each motion do the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Start the motion by playing the slider $u$ (time, measured in seconds) in Line 1.

\item Sketch by hand a graph of the function $s=g(\theta)$ that expresses the $s$-coordinate of the point $P$ as a function of the marked angle $\theta$, measured counterclockwise in radians. Label the coordinates of the axes with the appropriate variable names and units.

\item Sketch by hand a graph of the function $s=f(t)$ that expresses the $s$-coordinate of the point $P$ as a function of time measured in seconds as recorded by the parameter $u$ in Line 1 of the worksheet. Label the coordinates of the axes with the appropriate variable names and units. Then activate the folder \emph{Graph} in Line 2 to see how you did


\item Using the graph of the function $s=f(t)$ shown in the worksheet, describe the uniform circular motion that drives the oscillation about the mean as follows.
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the radius of the circular path.

\item Determine the rotation rate about the path's center.

\item Determine the $s$-coordinate of the path's center.

\end{enumerate}

\item Express the $s$-coordinate of the point $Q$ on the graph in terms of the marked polar angle $\theta$.

\item Express the polar angle $\theta$ in terms of $t$. Start by graphing the polar angle function $\theta = f(t)$.

\item Use the results of parts (b) and (c) to find an expression for the function $s=f(t)$. Check your work by substituting two of the given inputs.
