\section{Circles Not Centered at the Origin}
This section is about parameterizing circles centered at points other than the origin.

\begin{question}  \label{Ex:sdfdsfdfL}

Parameterize a circle with radius $3$ cm centered at the point $C(5,4)$ (coordinates measured in cm) in terms of the polar angle of the vector from $C$ to a point $P(x,y)$ on the circle.

\begin{explanation} 

Here are the steps, with the details left for you to fill in.

We'll start by letting $P$ be a point on the circle with coordinates $(x,y)$ and $\theta$ the polar angle of the vector $\overrightarrow{CP}$ giving the position of $P$ relative to $C$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First express the components of the vector $\overrightarrow{CP}$ in terms its polar angle $\theta$.

\item Next express the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ giving the position of $P$ relative to the origin in terms of $\overrightarrow{CP}$ and one other vector.

\item Use the results of parts (a) and (b) to express the components of the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ in terms of $\theta$.

\item Finally, use the result of part (c) to find functions
\[
    x = f(\theta)  \hskip 0.5 in \text{and} \hskip 0.5in  y=g(\theta) ,
\]
that express the coordinates of $P$ in terms of $\theta$. Include appropriate domains for these functions. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}  \label{QDF09dfdfLKDD}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Parametrize the circle in Question \ref{Ex:sdfdsfdfL} by the signed arclength from $A$ of a point $P(x,y)$ on the circle. Measure the signed arclength $s$ from the point $A(8,0)$ along the circle and take the counterclockwise direction to be positive.

The coordinate functions (in cm) are 
\[
  x = f_1(s) = \answer{5 + 3 \cos(s/3)} \, , \, s\in \mathbb{R}
\]
and
\[
   y = g_1(s) = \answer{4 + 3 \sin(s/3)} \, , \, s\in \mathbb{R} .
\]

\item Use part (a) to find the exact coordinates of the point on the circle  $20$ cm from $A$ as measured counterclockwise along the circle. 

\item Use the worksheet above to approximate these coordinates and check if your coordinates look reasonable.

\item Between noon and 12:02pm a beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle at a constant speed of $6$cm/sec, passing the point $A(8,0)$ at $23$ seconds past noon. Find coordinate functions
\[
   x = f_2(t)  \hskip 0.5 in \text{and} \hskip 0.5in  y=g_2(t) ,
\] 
that express the beetle's coordinates (in cm) in terms of the number of seconds past noon.
