\begin{question} \label{Qpdfeee3}
One end of a rope $L$ feet long is tied to the top of a pole $h$ feet high. The other end is tied to a hat. A woman puts the hat on her head and walks as far away from the pole as possible without the hat falling off.

Express the height of the woman in terms of $L$, $h$, and the angle $\theta$ the rope makes with the pole.

Start  by drawing a picture. Define any unknowns in complete sentences with units. Use single letters for the unknowns.

\begin{question} \label{QdfRERE3R}
You wrap a rubber band around a jar lid of radius $R$ cm and stretch the band as shown below.

Express the length (measured in cm) of the band in terms of $R$ and the distance $h$ between the point $P$ and the center of the lid, also measured in cm.

\begin{question}  \label{Q34f3r4gg}
You stand on the top of a building $50$ feet from a 200-foot tall building across the street. You measure the angle of depression to the base of the nearby building to be $\theta_1$ radians. You then measure the angle of elevation to the top of the same building to be $\theta_2$ radians. Express $\theta_2$ in terms of $\theta_1$.

Start by drawing a picture. Define any unknowns in complete sentences with units. Use single letters for the unknowns.

\begin{question} \label{QddtgHHEfeRER}
Sensors on the ground at points $A$ and $B$ below measure the angles of elevation to a plane to be $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, respectively, as shown below.

Express the altitdue of the plane (in km) in terms of the distance $s$ between the sensors (also measured in km).

Start by drawing a picture. Define any unknowns in complete sentences with units. Use single letters for the unknowns.
