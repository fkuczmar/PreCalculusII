\begin{example}  \label{Exp89dfe94tf4}

Between 12:00pm and 1:00pm a beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle of radius $30$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed, making one revolution every $14$ minutes.  It leaves the point $(30,0)$ at noon.

\begin{enumerate}

\item At what rate does the beetle rotate about the origin?

%\item Find a possible function 
%\[
%   \theta = b(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 60,
%\]
%that expresses the beetle's polar angle in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Start by graphing this function.

\item Find two possible values for the beetle's polar angle at 12:34pm. This is the angle the segment $\overline{OB}$ from the origin to the beetle makes with the postive $x$-axis.

\item Find the beetle's exact coordinates at 12:34pm \emph{without} using a calculator.

\item Use a calculator to approximate the beetle's coordinates at 12:34pm.

\end{example}


\begin{example} \label{Edfhg]hghgdfg}
A beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle of radius $40$ meters centered at the origin at a constant speed of $8$ meters/min, starting from the point $(40,0)$ (coordinates in meters) at noon and making $5$ complete revolutions before stopping.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a function
\[
    \theta = b(t)
\]
that expresses the beetle's polar angle in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domain.

The polar angle function is
\[
   \theta = b(t) = \answer{t/5} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item At what rate does the beetle turn about the origin?  $\answer{1/5}$ rad/min



\item Find functions
\[
   x = f_1(t) \text{ and } y=g_1(t)
\]
that express the beetle's coordinates (in meters)  in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Include the appropriate domains.

The coordinate functions are
\[
    x = f_1(t) = \answer{40\cos(\frac{1}{5}t)} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} 
\]
and 
\[
    y = f_1(t) = \answer{40\sin(\frac{1}{5}t)} \, , \, 0 \leq t \leq \answer{50\pi} .
\]

\item Enter these coordinate functions on Lines 3 and 4 of the worksheet below. Then play the slider $u$ (the number of minutes past noon) to check if they are correct.

\item Use your functions from part (c) to find the beetle's exact coordinates 35 minutes after it starts to crawl. Then use a calculator to approximate these coordinates.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Describe the uniform circular motion that drives the oscillation by stating
\begin{enumerate}
\item the center and radius of the circle, and

\item the rotation rate of the uniform circular motion. 
\end{enumerate}


\item Now let $P$ be the point moving around a circle that generates the oscillation. Find a function
\[
    \theta = a(t)
\]
that expresses the polar angle of $P$ in terms of the number of seconds since the mass was released. Start by graphing this function. 

\item Use your polar angle function to find a function 
\[
   x= f(t)
\]
that expresses the position of the oscillating mass in terms of the number of seconds since being released.

\item Use the animation above to approximate  the position (ie. $x$-coordinate) of the mass $1.75$ seconds after being released.

\item Find the exact position (ie. $x$-coordinate) of the mass $1.75$ seconds after being released. Then use a calculator to approximate this position to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter.

\item Use the animation to approximate the position of the mass $33.5$ seconds after being released. 

\item Find the exact position (ie. $x$-coordinate) of the mass $33.5$ seconds after being released. Then use a calculator to approximate this position to the nearest hundredth of a centimeter.

\item How would your answers to the questions above have changed if instead the mass were released from the point $(0,10)$?

\begin{example} \label{ExLKDr45533}
Between times $t=0$ and $t=12$ seconds a mass oscillates in simple harmonic motion along the $s$-axis between positions $s=-6$ m and $s=6$ m. with a period of four seconds. At time $t=7$ seconds the mass has position $s=3$ and is moving toward its equilibrium position $s=0$.
