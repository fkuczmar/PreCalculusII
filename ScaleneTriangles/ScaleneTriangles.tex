\begin{question} \label{Q0:SineCosine}
A loading ramp that makes an angle of $\pi/9$ radians with the ground is replaced with a new ramp that makes an angle of $\pi/18$ radinas with the ground. The new ramp is what percent longer than the original? Round your answer to the nearest percent.

The new ramp is approximately 
\[
   \answer{97}\% \text{ longer than the original.}
\]

\begin{question} \label{Q1:SineCosine}
You stand an unknown distance from the base of a building and measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be $\theta_1$ radians. You then walk an additional $m$ meters directly away from the building and measure the angle of elevation to its top to be $\theta_2$ radians. 

(a) Use right triangle trigonometry to express the height of the building above eye level (in meters) in terms of $s$, $\theta_1$, and $\theta_2$.


The height above eye level is 
\[
       \answer{\frac{m}{\cot\theta_2-\cot \theta_1}} \text{ feet}.
\]

(b) Use the law of sines to express the height of the building above eye level (in meters) in terms of $s$, $\theta_1$, and $\theta_2$.

The height above eye level is 
\[
       \answer{\frac{m \sin \theta_1 \sin\theta_2}{\sin(\theta_2-\theta_1)}} \text{ feet}.
\]

(c) Compare your answers to parts (a) and (b) to express $\sin(\theta_1 - \sin\theta_2)$ in terms of $\sin\theta_1$, $\cos\theta_1$, $\sin\theta_2$, and $\cos\theta_2$.
