\section{The Law of Sines and Relative Position}
We can use the law of sines to solve a new type of position problem.

\begin{example}  \label{Exer748gtgb}
Point $B$ is $6$ miles from point $A$ at a bearing of $0.3$ radians. Point $C$ lies at a bearing of $2.7$ radians relative to $B$ and at a bearing of $2.2$ radians relative to $A$. We wish to describe the positions of $C$ relative to $A$ and $B$.


(a) Sketch an accurate picture with points $A$, $B$, $C$ and the three vectors that describe the positions of $B$ relative to $A$, $C$ relative to $A$, and $C$ relative to $B$.

(b) Determine the exact distances from point $C$ to points $A$ and $B$.

\begin{explanation}
We first use the first demonstration below to draw an accurate picture. We begin by plotting point $A$ anywhere. We chose the origin. Then we center the radian protractor at $A$ with $r=6$ and plot point $B$.

To plot point $C$ is a bit trickier. The problem is that we do not know how far $C$ is from either $A$ or $B$. But we do know the bearings. So we center the protractor at $B$ and move point $B_1$ to make the ray $\overrightarrow{BB_1}$ have a bearing of $2.7$ radians (not shown). Then we center the protractor at $A$ and move $A_1$ to make the ray $\overrightarrow{AA_1}$ have a bearing of $2.2$ radians as shown below. The point where the rays $\overrightarrow{AA_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{BB_1}$ intersect tells us where to plot point $C$.  Then we drag $C$ to this position as shown in the second demonstration.

We next calculate the angles of $\Delta ABC$. 

Angle $\angle BAC$ is the angle from the vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ to $\overrightarrow{AC}$. So it has a radian measure 
\[
   \angle BAC = \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{AC} - \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{AB} = 2.2 - 0.3 = 1.9 .
\]


Angle $\angle BCA$ is the angle from the vector $\overrightarrow{AC}$ to the vector $\overrightarrow{BC}$. So it has radian measure
\[
   \angle BCA = \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{BC} - \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{AC} = 2.7 - 2.2 = 0.5 .
\]



%Finding the measure of $\angle ABC$ is a bit trickier. The angle $\angle ABC$ is the angle between the vectors $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$. Since $\overrightarrow{BA}$ points in the opposite direction of $\overrightarrow{AB}$, the vector $\overrightarrow{BA}$ has polar angle (bearing)
%\[
%  \theta_{BA} = \pi + \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{AB}  = \pi + 0.3.
%\]
%So the angle $\angle ABC$ has radian meausure
%\[
%    \angle ABC = \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{BA} - \text{polar angle of }\overrightarrow{BC} = \pi + 0.3 - 2.7 = \pi -  2.4.
%\]

Finally, since the angles of $\Delta ABC$ sum to $\pi$, the angle $\angle ABC$ has radian measure
\[
  \angle ABC = \pi - (1.9 + 0.5) = \pi -2.4.
\]

Now we use the law of sines in $\Delta ABC$. Since
\[
   \frac{|\overrightarrow{AB}|}{\sin (\angle BCA)} =\frac{|\overrightarrow{AC}|}{\sin (\angle ABC)} ,
\]
\[
     \frac{6}{\sin (0.5)} =\frac{|\overrightarrow{AC}|}{\sin (\pi - 2.4)},
\]
and
\[
   |\overrightarrow{AC}| = 6  \left( \frac{\sin (2.4)}{\sin (0.5)} \right)  \sim 8.45 .
\]

\begin{question}  \label{Q34rg4t5rt}
Explain why we can replace $\sin (\pi -  2.4)$ with $\sin (2.4)$ in the computation above. Include a picture to help with your explanation.
\end{question}

Similarly, since
\[
   \frac{|\overrightarrow{AB}|}{\sin (\angle BCA)} =\frac{|\overrightarrow{BC}|}{\sin (\angle BAC)} ,
\]
\[
     \frac{6}{\sin (0.5)} =\frac{|\overrightarrow{BC}|}{\sin (1.9)},
\]
and
\[
   |\overrightarrow{BC}| = 6  \left( \frac{\sin (1.9)}{\sin (0.5)} \right)  \sim 11.84 .
\]

So the approximate distances from $C$ to $A$ and from $C$ to $B$ are respectively $8.45$ miles and $11.84$ miles.

\end{explanation}

\section{Skip This Section for Now}

\begin{exploration}
The law of cosines, like the Pythagorean theorem, is really a statement about areas. But perhaps the simplest way to think about the law of cosines might be in terms of lengths. 

The figure below shows a way to visualize the law of cosines. To avoid fractions, we scale $\Delta ABC$ with side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$ , by the factor $c$, so that the scaled triangle (still called $\Delta ABC$) has side lengths $ac$, $bc$, and $c^2$.

Now the idea is to partition $\overline{AB}$ into three segments by finding points $C_A$ and $C_B$ on $\overline{AB}$ so that
\[ 
    \Delta ACC_A \sim \Delta C BC_B \sim \Delta ABC .
\]
Then in $\Delta ACC_A$,
\[
    AC_A = (b/c)(bc) = b^2
\]
and
\[
  CC_A = (b/c)(ac) = ab.
\]
And in $\Delta C BC_B $,
\[
    BC_B = (a/c)(ac) = a^2
\]
and
\[
  CC_B = (a/c)(bc) = ab.
\]

To determine the length of $CA_A C_B$, let $2\theta$ be the measure of $\angle C_A C C_B$. Then
\[
     2\theta + \alpha + \beta = \gamma ,
\]
and since
\[
    \alpha + \beta = \pi - \gamma ,
\]
\[
   \theta = \gamma - \pi/2.
\]
So with $M$ as the midpoint of $\overline{C_A C_B}$,
\[
   C_A C_B = 2 C_A M = 2ab \sin \theta = -2ab\cos\gamma .
\]

That's all we need, for since
\[
    AB = BC_B + C_B C_A + C_AA ,
\]
\[
  c^2 = a^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma + b^2 .
\]

But perhaps since $AB = BM +AM$ it might be better to write the law of cosines as
\[
   c^2 = (a^2 -ab\cos\gamma) + (b^2- ab\cos \gamma) .
\]

This suggests another, more abstract way of getting at the law of cosines. Because $AM = bc \cos \alpha$ and $BM = ac \cos\beta$,
\[
   c^2 = bc \cos \alpha + ac \cos \beta .
\]
Now the expressions 
\[
   f(a,b,c) = bc \cos\alpha
\]
and
\[
   g(a,b,c) = ac \cos \beta
\]
must be quadratic functions of $a$,$b$, $c$ and symmetric in the sense that
\[
  g(a,b,c) = f(b,a,c) .
\]
So if
\[
  f(a,b,c) = \lambda_1 a^2 + \lambda_2 b^2 + \lambda_3 c^2 + \lambda_4 ab + \lambda_5 ac + \lambda_6 bc ,
\]
then
\[
  g(a,b,c) = \lambda_1 b^2 + \lambda_2 a^2 + \lambda_3 c^2 + \lambda_4 ab + \lambda_5 bc + \lambda_6 ac  .
\]

\section{Relative Position}
Earlier in this class we solved problems about relative position by resolving vectors into their $x$ and $y$ components. Here we take a different approach and work with triangles instead.

 \begin{example}  \label{Exergt43tgr}
Point $B$ is $6$ miles due east of point $A$. Point $C$ is $8$ miles from $A$ at a bearing of $0.4$ radians. Desrcribe the position of $C$ relative to $B$ by giving a distance and a bearing.

\begin{explanation}
We start by drawing an accurate picture.

Next we'll work through the solution as usual, by working with the components of the vectors.

The vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$ has components
\[
   \overrightarrow{AB} = \langle 6, 0  \rangle
\]
measured in miles.

The vector $\overrightarrow{AC}$ has components
\[
    \overrightarrow{AC} = \langle 8 \cos (0.4), 8 \sin(0.4)  \rangle
\]
also measured in miles.

The vector $\overrightarrow{BC}$ that gives the position of $C$ relative to $B$ is
\begin{align*}
       \overrightarrow{BC} &= \overrightarrow{AC} - \overrightarrow{AB}    \\
                                    &= \langle 8 \cos (0.4), 8 \sin(0.4)  \rangle - \langle 6, 0  \rangle \\
                                    &= \langle 8 \cos (0.4) - 6, 8 \sin(0.4)  \rangle
\end{align*}

We'll now compute the \emph{square} of the distance from $B$ to $C$ as
\begin{align*}
         |  \overrightarrow{BC} |^2 &= |    \langle 8 \cos (0.4) - 6, 8 \sin(0.4)  \rangle    |^2  \\
                                             &= (8 \cos (0.4) - 6)^2 + (8 \sin(0.4))^2   \\
                                             &=  8^2 + 6^2 - 2(8)(6) \cos(0.4)
\end{align*}

\begin{question} \label{Q1:SineCosine}
You stand an unknown distance from the base of a building and measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be $\theta_1$ radians. You then walk an additional $s$ meters directly away from the building and measure the angle of elevation to its top to be $\theta_2$ radians.
