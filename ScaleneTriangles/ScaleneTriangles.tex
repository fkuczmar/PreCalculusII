\begin{question} \label{Q0:SineCosine}
A loading ramp that makes an angle of $\pi/9$ radians with the ground is replaced with a new ramp that makes an angle of $\pi/18$ radinas with the ground. The new ramp is what percent longer than the original? Round your answer to the nearest percent.

The new ramp is approximately 
\[
   \answer{97}\% \text{ longer than the original.}
\]

\begin{question} \label{Q1:SineCosine}
You stand an unknown distance from the base of a building and measure the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be $\theta_1$ radians. You then walk an additional $s$ meters directly away from the building and measure the angle of elevation to its top to be $\theta_2$ radians. 

(a) Use right triangle trigonometry to express the height of the building above eye level (in meters) in terms of $s$, $\theta_1$, and $\theta_2$.


The height above eye level is 
\[
       \answer{\frac{s}{\cot\theta_2-\cot \theta_1}} \text{ feet}.
\]

(b) Use the law of sines to express the height of the building above eye level (in meters) in terms of $s$, $\theta_1$, and $\theta_2$.

The height above eye level is 
\[
       \answer{\frac{s \sin \theta_1 \sin\theta_2}{\sin(\theta_2-\theta_1)}} \text{ feet}.
\]

(c) Compare your answers to parts (a) and (b) to express $\sin(\theta_1 - \sin\theta_2)$ in terms of $\sin\theta_1$, $\cos\theta_1$, $\sin\theta_2$, and $\cos\theta_2$.

\begin{question} \label{Q2:SineCosine}
At noon a sailboat is $10$ km due east of a motorboat. The motorboat travels at a constant speed of $v$ km/hour at a fixed bearing of $\theta_1$ radians (measured counterclockwise from the east), with $0<\theta_1 <\pi/2$. The sailboat travels in a fixed bearing at a constant speed of $kv$ km/hr, where $0<k<1$ Sometime later the boats collide.

(a) Express the two possible bearings $\theta_2$ and $\theta_3$ of the sailboat in terms of $v$, $k$, and $\theta_1$.

(b) Express the times of the collision in terms of $v$, $k$, $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$.

(c) Under what condition do the boats collide?

(d) Under what condition is there a unique collision time?

(e) Establish a rectangular coordinate system with the positive $x$-axis pointing due east, and the origin at the motorboat's position at noon. Then parameterize the motions of the motorboat and sailboat. Consider all possibilities.

(f) Fill in the missing lines in the Exploration below. Then play the slider $u$ to check that you are correct. Include at least two screenshots.
