\section{Circles not Centered at the Origin}


\begin{question}  \label{ExKdfeKR}
We'll parameterize a circle with radius $3$ cm centered at the point $C(5,4)$ (coordinates measured in cm) in terms of the polar angle of the vector from $C$ to a point $P(x,y)$ on the circle. The steps are outlined below.

\begin{explanation} 

Here are the steps, with the details left for you to fill in.

We'll start by letting $P$ be a point on the circle with coordinates $(x,y)$ and $\theta$ the polar angle of the vector $\overrightarrow{CP}$ giving the position of $P$ relative to $C$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item First express the components of the vector $\overrightarrow{CP}$ in terms its polar angle $\theta$.

\item Next express the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ giving the position of $P$ relative to the origin in terms of $\overrightarrow{CP}$ and the vector $\overrightarrow{OC}$.

\item Use the results of parts (a) and (b) to express the components of the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$ in terms of $\theta$.

\item Use the result of part (c) to find functions
\[
    x = f(\theta)  \hskip 0.5 in \text{and} \hskip 0.5in  y=g(\theta) ,
\]
that express the coordinates of $P$ in terms of $\theta$. Include appropriate domains for these functions. 

\item Use part (d) to find the coordinates of $P$ when $\theta=\pi/2, 3\pi/4, \pi$. Check that these results are correct.

\item Use part (d) to find the exact and approximate coordinates of $P$ when $\theta =4$. Use the worksheet above to check that the coordinates are reasonable (the slider $u$ in Line 1 is another name for the polar angle $\theta$.) 


\item One last question. Find equations in Cartesian coordinates of 

\begin{enumerate}
\item the unit circle centered at the origin and 

\item The circle of radius $3$ centered at  $C(5,4)$.

These equations express relationships between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of points on the circles. They do not involve the parameter $\theta$. 

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\end{explanation}
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{QDF09555dfdfLKDD}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Parametrize the circle in Question 1 by the signed arclength from $A$ of a point $P(x,y)$ on the circle. This means to express the coordinates $(x,y)$ of $P$ (measured in cm) in terms of its signed distance from $A$. Measure the signed arclength $s$ (in cm)  from the point $A(8,0)$ along the circle and take the counterclockwise direction to be positive.

The coordinate functions (in cm) are 
\[
  x = f_1(s) = \answer{5 + 3 \cos(s/3)} \, , \, s\in \mathbb{R}
\]
and
\[
   y = g_1(s) = \answer{4 + 3 \sin(s/3)} \, , \, s\in \mathbb{R} .
\]

\item Use part (a) to find the exact coordinates of the point on the circle  $20$ cm from $A$ as measured counterclockwise along the circle. 

\item Use the worksheet above to approximate these coordinates and check if your coordinates look reasonable.

\item Between noon and 12:02pm a beetle crawls counterclockwise around the circle at a constant speed of $6$cm/sec, passing the point $A(8,0)$ at $23$ seconds past noon. Find coordinate functions
\[
   x = f_2(t)  \hskip 0.5 in \text{and} \hskip 0.5in  y=g_2(t) ,
\] 
that express the beetle's coordinates (in cm) in terms of the number of seconds past noon.

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}



\begin{question}  \label{QDfg554egsE}
A beetle starts from the point $A(8,3)$, crawls $s$ meters counterclockwise around the circle centered at $Q(2,3)$ and stops at point $B$. All coordinates measured in meters.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the components of the vector $\overrightarrow{QB}$ in terms of $s$.

\item Express the vector $\overrightarrow{OB}$ in terms of the vectors $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and $\overrightarrow{QB}$, where $O$ is the origin.

\item Express the coordinates of $B$ in terms of $s$.

\item Find the exact coordinates of $B$ when $s=10$ meters. Then use a calculator to approximate these coordinates. Finally, use the worksheet below to check that your answer is reasonable.
\end{enumerate}
