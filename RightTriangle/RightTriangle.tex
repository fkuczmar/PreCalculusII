The most important thing to remember about right triangle trigonometry is that it only applies to right triangles.

\begin{question} \label{Q1:RightTriangle}
You stand $a$ meters from the base of a tall building and measure the angle of inclination to a point $P$ on the building. You then use that measurement to compute the height of the point $P$ above eye-level.

Let 
\[
    h = f(\theta) \, , 0\leq \theta < \pi/2 ,
\]
be the function that expresses that computed height (in feet) in terms of the measured angle (in radians).

(a) Draw a picture that captures the scenario. Include the ground, you, the building, the point $P$, the line of sight to $P$, and the angle $\theta$.

(b) Find an expression for the function $f$.

(c) There will be some error in your measurement that will lead to an error in computing the height of point $P$.
