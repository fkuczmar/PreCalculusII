\maketitle

You already know at least two ways to describe curves algebraically - as graphs of functions like $y=x^2$, or as graph of relations like $x^2 + y^2 = 3$. In this section, we introduce a third way and describe curves parametrically. 

To describe a curve in the plane \emph{parametrically} means to express the $x$ and $y$-coordinates as functions of a third variable called the \emph{parameter}. Often, but not always, the parameter measures time, and in this case the parameterization describes a \emph{motion}. It tells us the position of a point as a function of time. As such, the parameterization gives us much more information than just the path of the motion.

For example, it is relatively easy to describe the \emph{path} of the earth around the sun as an ellipse with one focus at the sun, having a certain shape and size. But is would be much more difficult to parameterize the motion of the earth around the sun, as this would require knowing the position of the earth at any time in its orbit.

In this class we will parameterize several different types of motions:

a. motion at a constant velocity

\pskip

b. projectile motion in a uniform gravitational field

\pskip

c. uniform circular motion

\pskip

d. motions around an ellipse

\pskip

This chapter focuses on the first, motion with a constant velocity.

\section{Motion with a Constant Velocity}

In colloquial English, velocity is a synonym for speed, as in ``A 747 has a maximum velocity of 650 miles/hour." But this is incorrect, as velocity is propery a vector that describes both speed and direction. So we might describe the velocity of a car by saying that it moves due north at a speed of 60 miles/hour. For an object to move with a constant velocity means that it travels in a fixed direction at a constant speed.

\noindent {\bf Example 1:} Between 11:58 am and 12:20pm a beetle crawls with a constant velocity, passing the point $A(-3,8)$ at 12:01pm and the point $B(10,-1)$ at 12:08pm, where the coordinates are measured in yards. Parameterize the beetle's motion.

\pskip

\noindent {\bf Solution:} The question is asking us to express the beetle's coordinates as functions of time, and we should start by precisely defining a variable that measures time. We'll do this by letting $t$ be the number of minutes past noon, so that for this problem $-2 \leq t \leq 20$. 

Now we need to find functions
\[
   x = f(t) \text{ and } y = g(t) , \text{ for } -2\leq t \leq 20 ,
\]
that express the coordinates of the beetle, measured in yards, in terms of the number of minutes past noon.  Since the velocity is constant, the coordinate functions change at a constant rate and are therefore linear.

First the $x$-coordinate. The $x$-coordinate changes at the rate of 
\[
    \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{10-(-3) \text{ yds}}{8-1 \text{ sec}} = \frac{13 \text{ yd}}{7 \text{ sec}}
\]
and (using point-slope) 
\[
     x = f(t) = -3 + \frac{13}{7}(t-1) , -2\leq t \leq 20 .
\]
